      question: "How quickly can I get started?",
      answer: "Most clinics are up and running within 24-48 hours. We handle the technical setup, train the AI on your services, and provide you with the embed code. You just copy and paste it into your website."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work with my existing booking system?",
      answer: "Yes! Netia AI integrates with all major booking platforms including Calendly, Acuity, Square, and custom systems. We can also send leads directly to your CRM or email."
    },
    {
      question: "What if the AI can't answer a question?",
      answer: "The AI is trained to handle 90%+ of common questions. For complex medical questions or situations it can't handle, it will politely direct the visitor to book a consultation or call your clinic directly."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my patient data secure?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We're HIPAA compliant and use enterprise-grade security. All conversations are encrypted, and we never store sensitive patient information. Your data stays private and secure."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the AI's responses?",
      answer: "Yes! You can customize the AI's personality, responses, and knowledge base. We'll train it on your specific services, pricing, and clinic policies during setup."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the setup fee?",
      answer: "The $299 setup fee includes custom AI training on your services, integration with your booking system, website embedding, staff training, and 30 days of support. No ongoing setup costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need any technical knowledge?",
      answer: "Not at all! We handle all the technical aspects. You just need to provide your website access and booking system details. Our team does the rest."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not satisfied?",
      answer: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the results, we'll refund your setup fee and cancel your subscription with no questions asked."
